     <p>Hii!</p>
     <h2> I'm Onwuli Charles Tobechukwu</h2>
    <p>Most people call me T-boy. I am a single 21 years old male. I was born in Lagos, Nigeria which is where I grew up and reside currently. I attended King’s College, Lagos, after which I gained admission into the University of Lagos where I’m currently studying for a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology. </p>
    <p>I am not easily motivated but when I set my mind toward achieving something I push it until I have my goals. Right from a young age I’ve been a tech enthusiast who always wished to work in the sector. I was majorly fascinated by the computer and the workings of the internet always piqued my interest hence my journey to becoming a front-end developer. </p>
    <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
    <p>When I’m not studying or coding my hobbies are; 
<ol>
  <li>Playing Video games.</li>
<li>Reading novels (I enjoy the fantasy genre especially)</li>
<li>Cycling</li>
</ol> 
I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends as I think that family is the most important unit that helps us keep sane. The family is where you get listened to and get valuable advice. I also offer therapy sessions to those dealing with psychological issues.
